# zhekoff's Enhanced Diplomacy Banners

**zhekoff's Enhanced Diplomacy Banners** is a UI improvement mod that transforms the diplomatic ribbon in Civilization VII. This mod provides a cleaner, more informative, and visually customizable interface for the diplomatic ribbons without affecting gameplay mechanics.

* **Sleek, Compact Design:** Completely redesigned diplomatic banners with a cleaner, more space-efficient layout (you can choose between 3 differnet scaling options if you want to have it more compact!)
* **More Statistics:** View additional metrics including military power, total gold reserves, total influence points, and population counts (configurable to show permanently or on hover)
* **Extensive Customization:**
    * Two relationship icon presets (Classic and Emoji)
    * Five background themes for different visual styles
    * Toggle civilization emblems for additional identity
    * Option to show/hide extended yields until hover
* **Flexible Display Modes:** Choose between always-visible banners or opt for the default Civ VII behavior (hidden until hover)
* **Leader Expression Control:** Option to disable dynamic leader expressions
