# zhekoff's Enhanced Diplomacy Banners

## [1.6.0] - 2025-03-17

## [1.5.0] - 2025-03-11
 - Add new user customization options:
    - You can now choose if you want to hide the banner with the Civilization symbol (by default it will be enabled).
    - You can now choose if you want to always display all yields, without having to hover over to see the additional yields (by default the additional yields will still only show on hover)
 - Fix "Sanctions" icon, it will be positioned on the portrait (thanks to @BrianKindly for the bug report)

## [1.4.0] - 2025-03-08
 - Add persistent settings, than enable you to choose the relationship icon preset you prefer (credit to @leonardify and @Leugi for this)
 - Add "Clasic" icon preset

## [1.3.1] - 2025-03-08
 - Fix bug that would break the attribute trees
 - Fix bug that would have the attribute icon shown behind the leader portrait

## [1.3.0] - 2025-03-08
 - Make leaders portraits circular, as that fits more with the design of the mod
 - Replace relationship icons with circular icons (mostly inspired by Civilization VI emoji's). They are also now part of the leader portrait.
 - Re-designed war support count banner
 - Restore proper hovering animations for leader portraits, and animations when their turn is active
 - Add identity to the Civilization banners - we have a banner strip (with the color of the player) visible with the Civilization symbol inside.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-03-06
- Make compatible with Patch 1.1.0 for Civ VII
- Modularize the mod, so it does not make conflicts with any other mods that modify the same files
- Added color indicators for each civilization, so there is better visual communication
- Detailed stats will be displayed only when you hover over the banner for a player, making it even more compact
- Move the diplomacy banners further to the right of the screen
- Add Korean localization (thanks to @Hotsolidinfill)

## [1.1.1] - 2025-02-23
- As each era can dynamically insert statistics (e.g. Antiquity Era can show Population count, Cities, Towns, and then hide this information in the next era), I have hardcoded it so all of the mod stat trackers are visible at all times.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-02-23
- New background for the diplomacy banners.
- Relationship icons are moved in the bottom, as they took up too much free space on the previous location (and causing an always empty space for the local player banner).
- Added new stat trackers - total gold, influence and population.
- Added a seperator between per-turn trackers and total trackers.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-02-09
- Initial release
